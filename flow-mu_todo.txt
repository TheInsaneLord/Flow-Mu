---- Tasks in Progress -----
1. add channel ignore command "?channel <subcommand>" to discord and possibly Twitch bot so that it will ignore messages from a list of channels in the database


---- Planned Tasks -----
1. create a memory system that allows notable data to be shared between chats. assign each message with a tag from 0-5 to represent the importance of the data
2. add types on the function parameters
3. add a relationship status to messages so users can build friendships or relationships with flow-mu (use a score between -1.000 to 1.000 0 is a neutral/default relationship)
4. add a system that allows flow-mu to be asked to message users and repeat the user's response.
5. save all lines generated by TTS for flow-mu to allow for voice cloning
7. share the history of users on different platforms possibly allow the user to add their own names  perhaps use a table with an FFID (flowmufrendid) that can be used as a reference in other tables
8. look into a way to allow flow-mu to see time from user's messages so she knows when someone last spoke to her


==========================
== Legal and other data ==
==========================
1. *create tos (created hosted on insane servers)
2. +look into a system that would allow for multible set animations to be interchanged in OBS allowing for idle anamations to be used for flow-mu
3. *check streaming platform for ToS agenst AI use. (no rules agenst it for twitch or youtube)

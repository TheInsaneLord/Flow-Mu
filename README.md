## FAQ

#### Why can't I turn on the AI and why is it not on 24/7?
The bot has been coded in a way so that when it is not in use it won't rack up bills and suddenly stop working 

#### Can I copy the code to use in my own bot
I would prefer you not to copy the complete code however I have no issue with you copying bits of the code to help get you started with your own bot.

### If I do make my bot using some of your code do I have to credit you?
If you have grately adjusted the code then no, however, if it is just a copy and past please provide credit

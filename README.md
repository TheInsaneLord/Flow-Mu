Flow-Mu is the chat companion of the Twitch streamer [The_Insane_Lord](https://www.twitch.tv/the_insane_lord) whose sole job is to help keep the chat happy and give them someone else to talk to.

This is the public side of code for the Flow-Mu bot used on [The_Insane_Lord](https://www.twitch.tv/the_insane_lord) Twitch chat and Discord it is missing some data to protect the sensitive code. This is here so anyone curious about how the bot works can have a look at the code. If you have suggestions for the bot such as adjustment to the code or adding new commands feel free to mention them on stream.

## FAQ

#### Why can't I turn on the AI and why is it not on 24/7?
The bot has been coded in a way so that when it is not in use it won't rack up bills and suddenly stop working 

#### Can I copy the code to use in my own bot
I would prefer you not to copy the complete code however I have no issue with you copying bits of the code to help get you started with your bot.

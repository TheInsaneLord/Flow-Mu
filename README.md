# Flow-Mu AI chatbot for Twitch and Discord 
 

**Flow-Mu** is the chat companion of the Twitch streamer [The_Insane_Lord](https://www.twitch.tv/the_insane_lord) whose sole job is to help keep the chat happy and give them someone else to talk to.

This is the public side of the code for the Flow-Mu bot used on [The_Insane_Lord](https://www.twitch.tv/the_insane_lord) Twitch chat and Discord. It is missing some data to protect the sensitive code. This is here so anyone curious about how the bot works can have a look at the code. If you have suggestions for the bot, such as adjustments to the code or adding new commands, feel free to mention them on stream.

## FAQ

#### Why can't I turn on the AI
The bot has been coded in a way so that when it is not in use, it won't rack up bills and suddenly stop working 

#### Can I copy the code to use in my own bot
I would prefer you not to copy the complete code however, I have no issue with you copying bits of the code to help get you started with your own bot. If you do use my code, please provide a link to this GitHub

### If I do make my bot using some of your code, do I have to credit you?
If you have greatly adjusted the code, then no, however, if it is just a copy and paste, please provide credit

### Why is there a ToS for Flow-mu
As of version 3 of Flow-mu, a [Terms of Service](https://insane-servers.co.uk/flow-mu_tos) has been put in place. This was done at the request of users, as they wanted security in knowing how the data Flow-mu uses was being handled 

## Plans for the future
